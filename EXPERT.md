- Pascal VOC 2012 dataset is widely used as a benchmark for different computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and object detection. However, according to the [Leaderboards for the Evaluations on PASCAL VOC Data](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/leaderboard/main_bootstrap.php) the most popular and traditional competition is on the task of semantic segmentation (authors name it as object segmentation task). In addition, the most common benchmark for object detection and instance segmentation is [COCO dataset](datasetninja.com/datasets/coco). 
- Another interesting aspect of this dataset is the presence of a neutral class. The boundary (internal and external pixels nearby the object edge) of every segmentation mask is marked with the special neutral class.
