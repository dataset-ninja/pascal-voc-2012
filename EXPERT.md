1. Pascal VOC 2012 dataset is widely used as a benchmark for different computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and object detection. However, according to the [Leaderboards for the Evaluations on PASCAL VOC Data](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/leaderboard/main_bootstrap.php) the most popular and traditional competition for this dataset is the semantic segmentation task (authors name it as object segmentation task). In addition, the most common benchmark for object detection and instance segmentation is the [COCO dataset](https://datasetninja.com/coco). 

1. Another interesting aspect of this dataset is the presence of a neutral class. The boundary (internal and external pixels nearby the object edge) of every segmentation mask is marked with the special neutral class. It is worth noting that the neutral mask is presented as a single mask for all objects on the image (i.e. authors of the dataset do not provide separate neutral masks for every object).

    Traditionally, a neutral class is used during neural network training - all pixels marked with this class do not take into account in training loss calculation. It allows to manually label object boundaries with less precision. Nowadays, this approach is not so popular thanks to the development of interactive tools that significantly speed up manual labeling and provide high-quality pixel-level segmentation. Here is an example of fast and accurate [interactive segmentation tools](https://supervisely.com/labeling-automation/ai-assisted-labeling/) in the [Computer Vision platform Supervisely](https://supervisely.com/):

1. This dataset is one of the most famous in Computer Vision and almost all deep learning libraries and frameworks support the data in its format out of the box. For example [MMSegmentation toolbox](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) ![GitHub Org's stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation?style=social). Also, most of the state-of-the-art neural network architectures for semantic segmentations have pretrained weights on Pascal VOC for transfer learning and faster model convergence during training. You can train a custom semantic segmentation model with this user-friendly [training app](https://ecosystem.supervisely.com/apps/mmsegmentation/train) in just a few clicks.

1. The images in the dataset exhibit a variety of scene types, lighting conditions, camera angles, and object shapes. Thus, Pascal VOC benchmark is quite challenging for Machine Learning researchers in comparison with other semantic segmentation benchmarks, like [Cityscapes](https://datasetninja.com/cityscapes) where image scenes are visually similar.
