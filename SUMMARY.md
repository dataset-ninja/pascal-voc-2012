CPPE - 5 (Medical Personal Protective Equipment) is a new challenging dataset with the goal to allow the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments, which is not possible with other popular data sets that focus on broad level categories.

Some features of this dataset are:

— high quality images and annotations (~4.6 bounding boxes per image)
— real-life images unlike any current such dataset
— majority of non-iconic images (allowing easy deployment to real-world environments)
