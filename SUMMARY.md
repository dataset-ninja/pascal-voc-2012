**PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (Segmentation Part)** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 7282 images with 19694 labeled objects belonging to 21 different classes including *neutral*, *person*, *chair*, and other: *car*, *cat*, *dog*, *bird*, *bottle*, *sofa*, *aeroplane*, *pottedplant*, *train*, *diningtable*, *motorbike*, *tvmonitor*, *bus*, *boat*, *horse*, *bicycle*, *cow*, and *sheep*.

Images in the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1456 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *trainval* (2913 images), *test* (1456 images), *train* (1464 images), and *val* (1449 images). The dataset was released in 2012 by the UK joint research group.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 21 classes:
