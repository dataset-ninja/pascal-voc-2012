**PASCAL VOC** (PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge) is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.
The dataset consists of 7282 images with 19694
labeled objects belonging to 21 different classes
including *neutral, person, chair*,
and other: *car, cat, dog, bird, bottle, sofa, aeroplane, pottedplant, train, diningtable, motorbike, tvmonitor, bus, boat, horse, bicycle, cow, and sheep*.


Each image in the PASCAL VOC dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 1456 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations).
There are 4 splits in the dataset: *test* (1456 images), *val* (1449 images), *train* (1464 images), and *trainval* (2913 images). The dataset was released in 2012 by the [University of Oxford](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 21 classes:
