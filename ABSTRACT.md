The **Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge** has been an annual event since 2006. The challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images obtained from the [Flickr web site](https://www.flickr.com/), together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. 

There are three principal challenges: classification — "does the image contain any instances of a particular object class?" (where object classes include cars, people, dogs, etc.), detection — "where are the instances of a particular object class in the image (if any)?", and segmentation — "to which class does each pixel belong?". In addition, there are two subsidiary challenges (<i>tasters</i>): action classification — "what action is being performed by an indicated person in this image?" (where actions include jumping, phoning, riding a bike, etc.) and person layout — "where are the head, hands and feet of people in this image?". The challenges were issued with deadlines each year, and a workshop held to compare and discuss that year's results and methods.
