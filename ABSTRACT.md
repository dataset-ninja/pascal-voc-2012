The main goal of this challenge is to recognize objects from a number of visual object classes in realistic scenes (i.e. not pre-segmented objects). It is fundamentally a supervised learning learning problem in that a training set of labelled images is provided. The twenty object classes that have been selected are:

* **Person**: *person*
* **Animal**: *bird*, *cat*, *cow*, *dog*, *horse*, *sheep*
* **Vehicle**: *aeroplane*, *bicycle*, *boat*, *bus*, *car*, *motorbike*, *train*
* **Indoor**: *bottle*, *chair*, *dining table*, *potted plant*, *sofa*, *tv/monitor*

There are three main object recognition competitions: <i>classification</i>, <i>detection</i>, and <i>segmentation</i>, a competition on <i>action classification</i>, and a competition on <i>large scale recognition</i> run by ImageNet. In addition there is a <i>"taster"</i> competition on person layout.
